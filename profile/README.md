### What is KegWatch?
KegWatch is a beer tracking system for your kegerator! Designed to be affordable, simple, and fun. Ease of installation sets KegWatch apart from other keg management solutions. No severed beer lines. No scales. No electronics inside the kegerator. Simply place the unit on top of your beer tower, attach the included magnets to your tap handles, and you are ready to go! 

KegWatch looks for the tap handles to open and close and estimates the amount of beer poured based on the flow rate of **your** draft system!
